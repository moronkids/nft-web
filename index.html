    <meta name="description" content="NFT Pizzeria is a collection of 3174 uniquely and
                  algorithmically generated humanized Pizza Slice. Owning a NFT
                  pizzeria, is not just holding an NFT but itâ€™s also owning a
                  piece of ownership of the first NFT Pizzeria Restaurant. In
                  Fact, our main goal is to open the first Physical NFT Pizzeria
                  in the World and be the First Project to let the first members
                  to be able to customize their own NFT Pizza Slice. Once the
                  100 Pizza Slice will be made, NFT Pizzeria will be open
                  randomly during the week and will let few lucky Discord
                  members to order customized pizza." />
